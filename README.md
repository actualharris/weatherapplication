ignore all the vulnerabilities

then, 
1. Switch to server folder, run the command "npm run dev" in cmd. This should start the backend server.

NOTE: 
1. This app only has a basic MongoDB connection. Feel free to comment the code from index.js inside server folder, for the server to work without using mongoose.

2. metaweather API is no longer active. Fetching weather data doesn't work anymore. Feel free to use any other weather APIs.
